# Machine-Learning-

Assignments done in Machine Learning

Implemented basic machine learning algorithms such as linear regression from scratch

Developed processing pipeline for protein classification task with exploratory data analysis and find best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
and experimented with different models like Linear SVM, RBF kernel SVM , Neural Network and Random Forest by using best hyperparameters

Executed Pytorch tutorial - use a pre-trained ConvNet as fixed feature extractor to extract domain-specific features for new tasks and compared
the results of various models with accuracy and f1-score
